## Phase 1

### Arithmetic Statement Parser 

- Parse the input statement through a Lexical Analyser and tokenise the Statements received in the input.
- Parse the tokens generated through a Syntax Tree mapping and a Parser to identify the character and their types.

## TODO
- Character Comparison to get punctuation symbols isn't working as expected. Need to be fixed.
